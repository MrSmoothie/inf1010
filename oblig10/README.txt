1)
The assignment was not really difficult, but the drawing of the code was confusing.

2)
I used about 30min coding it. (Most of it just trying to understand what was asked)

3)
I worked with/asked some friends on the topic of drawing the code in blocks.
Tobias, Sindre and Adrian for starters

4)
Everthing went smoothly.
