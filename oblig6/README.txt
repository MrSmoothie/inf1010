1. This was again a hard task to understand. I used about 6hours in total, but only 3 of these, were programming.
Most of you would be able to se the frustration in this. Anyways, getting used to it by now, so not worring to much.
2.Answered abow
3.I worked with Martin Nygaard and Tobias Noreng, and helped some others.
4.As i said earlier, there was some tasks i didnt really understood properly.
 In my definition this asignment asked us to make a command based software.
 Following this i made a commandbased system, but i didnt build the menu for it,
 as i though this wasnt supposed to be in the program. (Some of my fellow students
 kindof recommeneded me to make one last minuite, but i really didnt see the need for that.)
 Anyways, i solved the tasks at hand after my judgment, that some of it
 probably didnt hit that mark spot on. But im sure most of it did. Anyways, was an okey asignment, 
 but could be more clear in the assignment descirption
